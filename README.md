# [Example Alexa Ruby/Sinatra app](https://github.com/drhuffman12/example_alexa_ruby_sinatra)

* Goal
    * Create an Amazon Alexa skill that gets triggered when user says: `Alexa log a movement activity on Health Hero for 30 minutes`.
    * Alexa should log the activity.

There are several setup steps involved. Click on the links below:

* [Local Development Server Setup](doc/1.LocalDevServerSetup.md)

* [Alexa Skill Setup](2.AlexaSkillSetup.md)

* [Alexa Skill Testing](3.AlexaSkillTesting.md)

* Sensor logger app
  * This would wait for a 'start' notification, then start gathering data, and eventually either speak near your Alexa-enabled device or post the sensor data to your server (which would in turn post the data to your Alexa Skill),

  * For this example, we will mock the sensor data and use a slightly different request (`ask example health hero log my movement`). (Maybe 'un-mock' later.)
  
  * However, you might want to create your own and/or use/mix existing apps. For example, see:
