# Example Alexa Ruby/Sinatra app

* Goal
    * Create an Amazon Alexa skill that gets triggered when user says: "Alexa log a movement activity on Health Hero for 30 minutes"
    * Alexa should log the activity.

## Local Devlopment Server Setup
----

* Download and unzip [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

* Configure your firewall settings.

  * e.g.: allow on port 8080 for this example

* Start ngrok using the port specified

```bash
cd $MY_WORKSPACE/example_alexa_ruby_sinatra
ngrok http 8080
```

* Note the `Forwarding` address mapping
  * We'll need to use the `https://<subdomain>.ngrok.io` part later in the `Endpoint` configuration.

  * e.g.:

```
Forwarding                    https://03795abd.ngrok.io -> localhost:8080
```

* Clone this repo:
  * If you used a different port for ngrok, adjust the port specified by `set :port, 8080` in the repo's `lib/example_alexa_ruby_sinatra/server.rb` file accordingly.

```bash
cd $MY_WORKSPACE
git clone https://github.com/drhuffman12/example_alexa_ruby_sinatra.git
cd example_alexa_ruby_sinatra
```

* Start the app

```bash
cd $MY_WORKSPACE/example_alexa_ruby_sinatra
bin/server
```

### Testing

Under the "Test" tab, go to the "Alexa Simulator" sub-tab and do the following:

- Select the language of your choice
- Click into the text box
- Make a request to Alexa in this format (or type the following and press enter): `ask <skill-name> <intent-utterance>`
  - e.g.: `ask Example Health Hero log my movement`

  - Alexa should respond with:
    - ""

  - If there is a problem, Alexa might respond with one of the below common problem responses. (Check in the `Device Log`. Click on `<timestamp> - Directive: SkillDebugger.CaptureError` or `<timestamp> - Directive: SkillDebugger.CaptureDebuggingInfo` and view the details.)

    - `There was a problem with the requested skill's response`
      - if your skill is configured properly and your request to Alexa was: `ask Example Health Hero log my movement`, but the response in your sinatra is not yet set up as Alexa is expecting

      - <img src="doc/screenshots/alexa_skill_testing/1.a.example_error.png" width="25%" height="25%" valign="top"/> <img src="doc/screenshots/alexa_skill_testing/1.b.directive_skill_debugger_capture_error.png" width="25%" height="25%" valign="top"/> <img src="doc/screenshots/alexa_skill_testing/1.c.server_response_snippet.png" width="25%" height="25%" valign="top"/>

    - `<Audio only response>`
      - if it didn't understand at all
        - e.g.: if your request to Alexa was something like: `foo bar`

    - `Sorry, I'm not sure.`
      - if it didn't understand at all
        - e.g.: if your request to Alexa was something like: `ask foo bar`
