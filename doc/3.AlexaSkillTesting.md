### Alexa Simulator

Under the "Test" tab, go to the "Alexa Simulator" sub-tab and do the following:

- Select the language of your choice
- Click into the text box
- Make a request to Alexa in this format (or type the following and press enter): `ask <skill-name> <intent-utterance>`
  - e.g.: `ask example health hero log my movement`

  - Alexa should respond with something like:
    - "You have moved eight steps. (Check in the `Device Log`. Click on `<timestamp> - Directive: SpeechSynthesizer.Speak` and view the details.)

  - If there is a problem, Alexa might respond with one of the below common problem responses. (Check in the `Device Log`. Click on `<timestamp> - Directive: SkillDebugger.CaptureError` or `<timestamp> - Directive: SkillDebugger.CaptureDebuggingInfo` and view the details.)

    - `There was a problem with the requested skill's response`
      - if your skill is configured properly and your request to Alexa was: `ask Example Health Hero log my movement`, but the response in your sinatra is not yet set up as Alexa is expecting
